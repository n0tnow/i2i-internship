# Basic Ping Test with Cloud Service (CLOUD-EX-01-i2i)

This project demonstrates how to create a remote virtual machine (instance) using a cloud service provider and test the network connection by sending a `ping` command from the local machine to the cloud instance.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Provider Used

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2**

## üîß Steps Performed

1. A free-tier AWS account was created.
2. An EC2 virtual machine (instance) was launched using the AWS Console.
3. The following configurations were applied:
   - Operating System: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
   - Instance Type: t3.micro (free tier eligible)
   - Security Group Rules:
     - SSH (port 22) ‚Üí for remote access
     - ICMP (All IPv4) ‚Üí for allowing ping tests
4. The instance‚Äôs `Public IPv4` address was retrieved: `16.171.17.42`
5. A `ping` test was executed from the local machine to verify the network connection.
